[nobles-quick-check](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2222752/nobles-quick-check)

>Can you use cards AND chips to buy nobles or just cards?

It is clear in the rules that you can't use chips, and you don't buy a noble as an action, but rather receive it automatically at the end of your turn.

>Why does anyone bother with nobles as they are all worth about 3 points which is no better than a mid-range 3 card?

The noble visits you whether you like it or not.
If you have enough cards, you are only visited by one noble on your turn, even if you qualify for more than one. If you qualify for more than one, you choose which one visits you.

[splendor-rule-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1246614/splendor-rule-question)

>You have the option of buying a card (cost of the card is 3 red gems).
You already have 3 red cards in front of you and you also have 3 red gems. What should I pay?

You pay nothing. If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.

The rules say clearly that you can discard from any of the tokens you have including those you have just picked up.

No. From the game setup rules section: "The remaining tiles are removed from the game; they will not be used during the game."

Yes but to take 2 gems of a single color, you MUST be taking from a stack of at least 4, so that you leave at least 2 after you take them.

>Suppose a player has more than ten tokens at the end of their turn, but nobody noticed. What rules can be used to resolve this when somebody does notice at a later point in time?

Suppose its during a 4-player game. Player 1 takes too many tokens, and no one notices at the time. Players 2 and 3 take their turns. Then the error is discovered on Player 4's turn. Perhaps the excess tokens are returned. However, if that would have altered Player 2's and Player 3's turns because the tokens needed wasn't available at the time, you have to redo the last two turns Or allow Player 2, then Player 3, to exchange tokens (assuming they took tokens on their turns), based on the tokens that Player 1 just returned to fix the error.

No. Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token.

[gold-coin](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2996202/gold-coin)

>What do you do with gold coin after you reserve a card?

It's important to keep the gold tokens together with your other tokens to ensure that you don't accidentally exceed the limit of ten tokens.
However, you can spend it on any card purchase.

The rules say you are allowed to discard a non-Gold chip at the end of your turn to get down to 10.

You should first buy the lower cost cards that offer discounts. The gem on these cards count as gems for buying other cards. So after collecting several of the lower cost cards, you can use the gems on them as well as the poker chips to buy the more expensive cards.

>What is the set up for a 4 player game?

In the 3-player game, there are 2 tokens fewer of each gem than in the 4-player game (and an addition 1 fewer in the 2-player game). Perhaps since there are 4 each in the 2-player game, which removes 3 from what you have in the 4-player game, the 4-player game is thus played with 7 tokens for each gem.

[can-you-pass](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1315391/can-you-pass)

>if you're holding 10 gems (poker chips), can you pass your turn if the gem you would like to have isn't available in the supply?

You may pass and actually do nothing only if (1) there are no gem tokens to take; (2) you have already reserved three development cards; (3) you cannot buy any of the development cards face-up on the table; and (4) you cannot buy any of three development cards that you have reserved.

For #4, you must reveal your hand to the other players to prove that you cannot buy them. (You have to reveal only if you are passing.)

If you have not reserved three development cards, you cannot pass, even if no gold tokens remain.

You can decide what to do. Perhaps considering that you cannot hold more than 10 gems from the end of one turn to the next, you can always get rid of any emerald gems that you feel are unneeded when you take 2 or 3 new gems from the supply.

The noble tiles do not return. However, the last sentence in the "The nobles" states "The tile obtained is placed face-up in front of the player in question."
So each noble visits at most one of the players and then stays there, meaning that he/she cannot be obtained by another player meeting the requirements later.
