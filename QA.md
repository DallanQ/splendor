>Can you use cards AND chips to buy nobles or just cards?

It is clear in the rules that you can't use chips, and you don't buy a noble as an action, but rather receive it automatically at the end of your turn.

----
Page 3

At the end of their turn, a player automatically receives the visit from a noble if that player has the amount of bonuses (and only bonuses) required, and they get the corresponding tile.

----
Page 3

If a player has enough development cards to amass 3 blue bonuses, 3 green bonuses, and 3 white bonuses, then that player automatically receives a visit from that noble.

>Why does anyone bother with nobles as they are all worth about 3 points which is no better than a mid-range 3 card?

The noble visits you whether you like it or not.
If you have enough cards, you are only visited by one noble on your turn, even if you qualify for more than one. If you qualify for more than one, you choose which one visits you.

----
Page 4

It is impossible to refuse the visit from a noble, which is not considered to be an action. 

If a player has enough bonuses to be visited by more than one noble at the end of their turn, that player chooses the noble to be received. 

[splendor-rule-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1246614/splendor-rule-question)

>You have the option of buying a card (cost of the card is 3 red gems).
You already have 3 red cards in front of you and you also have 3 red gems. What should I pay?

You pay nothing. If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.

----
Page 3

To purchase a card, a player must spend the number of tokens indicated on the card. A joker token can replace any color. The spent tokens (including any jokers) are returned to the middle of the table.

----
Page 4

Thus, if a player has 2 blue bonuses and wants to purchase a card which costs 2 blue tokens and 1 green token, the player must only spend 1 green token. 

If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.

[token-selection-is-broken](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2265467/token-selection-is-broken)

> If you get new tokens and exceed the 10 token limit, can you discard tokens from the ones you just got or from the ones you already have?

The rules say clearly that you can discard from any of the tokens you have including those you have just picked up. 

----
Page 3

A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of 
their turn (including jokers). If this happens, they must return 
tokens until they only have 10 left. A player can return all or 
some of those they've just drawn. The tokens owned by a 
player must be visible by all players at all times.

[pick-gem](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2634390/pick-gem)

>If I cannot take 3 different gem color tokens because there are only 2 colors left, will I be allowed to take the other 2?

Yes but to take 2 gems of a single color, you MUST be taking from a stack of at least 4, so that you leave at least 2 after you take them.

----
Page 3

- Take 2 gem tokens of the same color. 
  This action is only possible if there are at least 4 tokens of the chosen color left when the player takes them.

----
Page 3

Players may not take 2 tokens of the same color if there are less than 4 tokens available of that color.

>Suppose a player has more than ten tokens at the end of their turn, but nobody noticed. What rules can be used to resolve this when somebody does notice at a later point in time?

Suppose its during a 4-player game. Player 1 takes too many tokens, and no one notices at the time. Players 2 and 3 take their turns. Then the error is discovered on Player 4's turn. Perhaps the excess tokens are returned. However, if that would have altered Player 2's and Player 3's turns because the tokens needed wasn't available at the time, you have to redo the last two turns Or allow Player 2, then Player 3, to exchange tokens (assuming they took tokens on their turns), based on the tokens that Player 1 just returned to fix the error.

----

A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of

>If I have already reserved 3 cards, can I take a gold token without reserving a card?

No. Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token.

----
Page 3

- Take 3 gem tokens of different colors. 
- Take 2 gem tokens of the same color. 
  This action is only possible if there are at least 4 tokens of the chosen color left when the player takes them.
- Reserve 1 development card and take 1 gold token (joker). 
- Purchase 1 face-up development card from the middle of the 
  table or a previously reserved one.

[gold-coin](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2996202/gold-coin)

>What do you do with gold coin after you reserve a card?

It's important to keep the gold tokens together with your other tokens to ensure that you don't accidentally exceed the limit of ten tokens.
However, you can spend it on any card purchase.

----
Page 3

The reserved cards are kept in hand and cannot be discarded. Players may not have more than three reserved cards in hand, and the only way to get rid of a card is to buy it (see below). Reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token (joker). If there is no gold left, you can still reserve a card, but you won't get any gold.

[does-the-youngest-player-always-go-first](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1587194/does-the-youngest-player-always-go-first)

>Does the youngest player always go first?

From game rules, the youngest player begins

----
Page 3

The youngest player begins. Play then proceeds clockwise.


[reserve-a-development-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2286411/reserve-a-development-card)

>If i have enough token to buying the development card. Can i reserve the development card?

Yes you can reserve it.

----
Page 3

To reserve a card, a player simply needs to take a face-up development from the middle of the table or (if you're feeling lucky) draw the first card from one of the three decks (level one circle ; two circles ; three circles) without showing it to the other players. 

----
Page 3

*Important: when a development card from the middle of the table is acquired or reserved, it must immediately be replaced by a card of the same level.* 

[no-moves-possible](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1374686/no-moves-possible)

>If i have 3 cards in my hand (reserved), and 10 gem tokens. Can i purchase additional card?

Yes. You can exceed 10 gems as long as you are back down to 10 at the end of your turn.

----
Page 3

A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of 
their turn (including jokers). If this happens, they must return 
tokens until they only have 10 left. A player can return all or 
some of those they've just drawn. The tokens owned by a 
player must be visible by all players at all times.

[the-10-gem-rule](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1291537/the-10-gem-rule)

>If at the start of your turn, you have 10 gems. You decide to pick up a card and get a gold (wild) chip. Now that it's the end of your turn and you have 11 chips but are limited to 10. Would you discard another gem to keep the gold or would you not get the gold since you already have 10?

The rules say you are allowed to discard a non-Gold chip at the end of your turn to get down to 10.

Page 3

A player can never have more than 10 tokens at the end of 
their turn (including jokers). If this happens, they must return 
tokens until they only have 10 left. A player can return all or

>If we all played and finished the same round with the winning score being reached does the game end straight immediately or do we play another round?

The game ends immediately.

----
Page 3

As soon as a player reaches 15 prestige points, the current turn ends and the player with the most prestige points is declared the winner.

----
Page 4

When a player reaches 15 prestige points, complete the current round so that each player has played the same number of turns. 

The player who then has the highest number of prestige points is declared the winner (don't forget to count your nobles). In case of a tie, the player who has purchased the fewest development cards wins.
