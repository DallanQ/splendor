[nobles-quick-check](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2222752/nobles-quick-check)

>Can you use cards AND chips to buy nobles or just cards?

It is clear in the rules that you can't use chips, and you don't buy a noble as an action, but rather receive it automatically at the end of your turn.

>Why does anyone bother with nobles as they are all worth about 3 points which is no better than a mid-range 3 card?

The noble visits you whether you like it or not.
If you have enough cards, you are only visited by one noble on your turn, even if you qualify for more than one. If you qualify for more than one, you choose which one visits you.

>You have the option of buying a card (cost of the card is 3 red gems).
You already have 3 red cards in front of you and you also have 3 red gems. What should I pay?

You pay nothing. If a player has enough development cards (and therefore bonuses), they can even purchase a card without spending any tokens.

Suppose its during a 4-player game. Player 1 takes too many tokens, and no one notices at the time. Players 2 and 3 take their turns. Then the error is discovered on Player 4's turn. Perhaps the excess tokens are returned. However, if that would have altered Player 2's and Player 3's turns because the tokens needed wasn't available at the time, you have to redo the last two turns Or allow Player 2, then Player 3, to exchange tokens (assuming they took tokens on their turns), based on the tokens that Player 1 just returned to fix the error.

In the 3-player game, there are 2 tokens fewer of each gem than in the 4-player game (and an addition 1 fewer in the 2-player game). Perhaps since there are 4 each in the 2-player game, which removes 3 from what you have in the 4-player game, the 4-player game is thus played with 7 tokens for each gem.

You may pass and actually do nothing only if (1) there are no gem tokens to take; (2) you have already reserved three development cards; (3) you cannot buy any of the development cards face-up on the table; and (4) you cannot buy any of three development cards that you have reserved.

For #4, you must reveal your hand to the other players to prove that you cannot buy them. (You have to reveal only if you are passing.)

If you have not reserved three development cards, you cannot pass, even if no gold tokens remain.

The noble tiles do not return. However, the last sentence in the "The nobles" states "The tile obtained is placed face-up in front of the player in question."
So each noble visits at most one of the players and then stays there, meaning that he/she cannot be obtained by another player meeting the requirements later.

The game rules say "On their turn, a player must choose to perform only one of the following four actions.

You can return any tokens you want to get down to 10.
The statement "A player can return all or some of those they’ve just drawn," is there just to emphasize that your are not constrained to returning tokens you had at the beginning of the turn.

In particular, the following is allowed: you start a turn with 9 tokens, take one each of Emerald, Sapphire, and Ruby, and then return the Sapphire and Ruby.

Maybe you really needed an Emerald - and wanted to keep the 9 tokens with which you started the turn. This is a legal way to get that Emerald.

> Is it possible for cards reserved from the face-up cards become hidden in your hand?

Cards you reserve are always hidden. They go right to your hand. Cards in hand are never shown.

>Two people had 15 points and the same amount of development cards. One had two nobles and one had one. Who would win that, or would it be house rules?

End of the game rules in page 4 says In case of a tie, the player who has purchased the fewest development cards wins.

>if there are only two (or even one) colors of gem chips remaining, is "taking 3 chips" still a legal move? If so, do you simply take 1 of each chip that is available, but end up only actually obtaining 1 or 2 instead of the full 3?

Yes, the chips are a limited resource so you would only take what is available, not forgetting that you can only take 2 of the same color if there are at least 4 there.

>Am I able to choose Gold Jokers as my token selection when I take 2 of them same or 3 different tokens as my action? Or do I only get these when I take a card to hand?

You get it only when you take a card to hand.

>When you have a Joker (gold coin) in your possession and you want to use it to buy something, does the Joker go back to the house after you buy something, or can you just keep it and use it over and over?

The spent tokens (including any jokers) are returned to the middle of the table.

>Is it possible to take one gold without reserving a card?

The rules say that reserving a card is also the only way to get a gold token (joker).
